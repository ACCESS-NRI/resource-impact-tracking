# Tracking ACCESS-NRI Resource-use and Impact

This repository is used to plan infrastructure associated with impact and resource use tracking. In the first instance this is a "meta-repository", for planning purposes. It may contain infrastructure code in the future, but it may also be the case that specific projects are spun out into their own repositories when required.

Tracking the use of resources "purchased" by ACCESS-NRI at other NCRIS partner facilities is a critical capability for management and reporting. 

Resources include HPC compute and storage, much of which is planned to be distributed to [ACCESS-NRI Community Working Groups](https://www.access-nri.org.au/working-groups/) to be used to run ACCESS models. 

Automated tracking capabilities include:
- disk usage
- compute usage
- data access: by who, and how frequently, ACCESS-NRI data products and supported datasets are accessed
- model usage: by who, and how frequently, ACCESS-NRI models are run

Qualitative tracking:
- tool usage: who is using software tools developed by ACCESS-NRI, and the impact it has on their work
- user stories: capture user workflows to identify productivity barriers and quantify any ACCESS-NRI related improvements

All this must be reported to NCRIS to show the positive impact ACCESS-NRI has on the community to justify the funding it receives.
